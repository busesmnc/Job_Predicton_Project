Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the world's leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles. Teams meet two to four times yearly in person, in interesting locations around the world, to align on strategy and execution.
The company is founder led, profitable and growing.
We are hiring
2024 and 2025 Graduate Software Engineers
into engineering teams around the world. As a global platform company we offer a wide range of software engineering challenges, in both open source products and commercial business systems. We have teams that work in a variety of languages, typically Python, Golang, Rust, C/C++, JavaScript and of course... Bash. We work from the very lowest levels of the Linux system - BIOS and boot loaders, firmware, kernel and drivers, all the way up to desktop applications and containers. We work on tiny devices like the Raspberry Pi and new RISC-V boards, all the way up to supercomputers, clouds and Kubernetes clusters. We work on compilers and toolchains, and we work on security, cryptography, performance and documentation. Some of our teams focus on packaging thousands of pieces of software, others focus on deep contributions to a single body of code.
If you are excited about the potential that open source has for humanity and the enterprise, you have outstanding results in your academic career, and you are excited to contribute to the open source stack, this is the best way to apply to Canonical. We will work with you to identify teams and projects that would be interesting and a good fit for your skills and motivations.

Most of our engineering teams work from home. We try to align a single team in a single time zone - EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), APAC (Asia Pacific and Indian Ocean), and AMER (North, South and Central Americas). Even though you work from home, we try to ensure you always have colleagues alongside to coach and mentor you, and for the companionship of shared problem solving and pair programming. Larger projects have multiple teams and might span the globe. We work with the open source community and specialize in building teams that work well in the 'fishbowl' of open source engineering. This is full time work, five days a week, often solving hard problems with significant responsibility. We don't generally work weekends and nights and we do enjoy good holidays but we also expect productive and intense engagement Monday to Friday.
We bring all our engineering teams together in person twice a year for a deep 'sprint' with other teams to stimulate discussion and enable a wide range of career development paths. This is a fantastic way to demonstrate and develop your skill in software, learn about a wide range of technologies, make a meaningful impact to open source, and see some very interesting new cities that you might never otherwise get to visit.

Canonical is a leading provider of open source software and operating systems to the global enterprise and technology markets. Our platform, Ubuntu, is very widely used in breakthrough enterprise initiatives such as public cloud, data science, AI, engineering innovation, and IoT. Our customers include the world's leading public cloud and silicon providers, and industry leaders in many sectors. The company is a pioneer of global distributed collaboration, with 1200+ colleagues in 75+ countries and very few office-based roles.

The company is founder led, profitable and growing.
We are hiring

into engineering teams around the world. As a global platform company we offer a wide range of software engineering challenges, in both open source products and commercial business systems. We have teams that work in a variety of languages, typically Python, Golang, Rust, C/C++, JavaScript and of course... Bash. We work from the very lowest levels of the Linux system - BIOS and boot loaders, firmware, kernel and drivers, all the way up to desktop applications and containers. We work on tiny devices like the Raspberry Pi and new RISC-V boards, all the way up to supercomputers, clouds and Kubernetes clusters. We work on compilers and toolchains, and we work on security, cryptography, performance and documentation. Some of our teams focus on packaging thousands of pieces of software, others focus on deep contributions to a single body of code.

Even though you work from home, we try to ensure you always have colleagues alongside to coach and mentor you, and for the companionship of shared problem solving and pair programming. Larger projects have multiple teams and might span the globe. We work with the open source community and specialize in building teams that work well in the 'fishbowl' of open source engineering. This is full time work, five days a week, often solving hard problems with significant responsibility. We don't generally work weekends and nights and we do enjoy good holidays but we also expect productive and intense engagement Monday to Friday.
We bring all our engineering teams together in person twice a year for a deep 'sprint' with other teams to stimulate discussion and enable a wide range of career development paths. This is a fantastic way to demonstrate and develop your skill in software, learn about a wide range of technologies, make a meaningful impact to open source, and see some very interesting new cities that you might never otherwise get to visit.

We work from the very lowest levels of the Linux system - BIOS and boot loaders, firmware, kernel and drivers, all the way up to desktop applications and containers. We work on tiny devices like the Raspberry Pi and new RISC-V boards, all the way up to supercomputers, clouds and Kubernetes clusters. We work on compilers and toolchains, and we work on security, cryptography, performance and documentation.

Project Manager,Portfolio Coordinator - Urban Missions (Home-Based),Greater Istanbul,2 week,72,No workplace info,No employment info,"About the job
Background
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion are core principles at UNDP: we value diversity as an expression of the multiplicity of nations and cultures where we operate, we foster inclusion as a way of ensuring all personnel are empowered to contribute to our mission, and we ensure equity and fairness in all our actions. Taking a ‚Äòleave no one behind‚Äô approach to our diversity efforts means increasing representation of underserved populations. People who identify as belonging to marginalized or excluded populations are strongly encouraged to apply. Learn more about working at UNDP including our values and
inspiring stories.
UNDP does not tolerate sexual exploitation and abuse, any kind of harassment, including sexual harassment, and discrimination. All selected candidates will, therefore, undergo rigorous reference and background checks.
The role of the Portfolio Coordinator for Urban Missions will be to support mission-based urban planning under the Mayors for Economic Growth Facility and the Slovak Transformation Fund initiatives.
Since 2021, the IRH Innovation Team has led the regional implementation of the EU-funded ‚ÄúMayors for Economic Growth‚Äù (M4EG), implemented in five Eastern Partnership (EaP) Countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine). The M4EG offers resources, networking and learning opportunities to explore new trajectories of growth and to make towns and cities more attractive for people and investment through new ways of local economic planning. The M4EG takes a 'hyperlocal' and whole-of-place approach and offers training and capability development opportunities for local authorities through the Urban Learning Center, as well as grant programmes for municipalities to test new approaches and tools. As of end of 2024, the network of mayors/municipalities totals 433, with close to 50 of those implementing grants at the local level. 10 cities have been developing their comprehensive Urban Transformation Portfolios with the mission-based approach (utilizing UNDP‚Äôs Portfolio Design & Management approach) to address their complex development challenges ranging from topics like energy transition into start-up ecosystem development and digital cultural heritage. See the M4EG website (eum4eg.com) for more information on the second phase of the initiative.
In the new phase of the M4EG (2025-2028) the main objective of the M4EG is inclusive, green and innovative economic revival of secondary cities in EaP through systemic local economic planning, enhanced access to finance, amplified future-ready capabilities and strengthened local, regional and global networks.
The Facility Will Focus On Two Main Outcomes
Improved and adaptive systemic local-level economic development planning and implementation through improved tools and capabilities for mission-oriented development and;
Enhanced access to financing for local authorities through support for pipeline development and financing absorption and management.
The new phase of the M4EG will run a Mission-Oriented Economy Programme to support up to 20 secondary cities within the M4EG network in developing a framed mission for their economies. This programme aims to build local capacities, drive economic and social development, and attract diverse investments in thematic areas such as the inclusive green transition, blue economy, urban resilience, smart and inclusive transitions and cultural economy. Participating cities will design systemic interventions that propose new ways of working within local administrations, enhance cross-sectoral collaboration, and positively impact city vibrancy while embracing technological advancements. The primary focus is on secondary cities across the EaP region, with seed investments allocated to 20 local authorities to develop interconnected portfolios tailored to local contexts. The action will support local authorities in designing and implementing mission portfolios of interventions that are connected (addressing multiple system levers), cross-sectoral (cutting across governance, economy, and environment), and dynamic (generating insights every three months to inform future investments and create new options). A design principle for all interventions is local ownership, community engagement and gender quality. The approach aims to enhance local governments' capabilities in collaborative project design and iteration, improve project invertibility, and leverage diverse funding sources.
The Slovak Transformation Fund is a project within the Innovation Team in the Regional Bureau for Europe and Central Asia. We take a systems thinking-based approach to addressing the complex development challenges of the region, collaborating closely with public, private and nonprofit sectors. The main objective of the Slovak Transformation Fund (STF) is to drive meaningful system transformation in the Eurasia region. This will be achieved by deploying systems approaches that demonstrably enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of local ecosystems, engaging stakeholders in co-creation processes to address complex challenges, fostering innovation and resilience, and leveraging innovative sources of financing to increase investment in pilots and initiatives that can drive change. The STF aims to achieve tangible effects for the green, just and smart transitions, thereby contributing to a more dynamic and sustainable future for the region.
The Project Achieves This In Two Main Ways
Through City Experiment Fund (CEF), by working directly with cities to address their complex challenges and develop portfolios of innovative solutions. STF supports them in testing and implementing these ideas, using a flexible, learning-based approach.
Through BOOST Acceleration program, STF accelerates the growth of promising innovators (e.g. CSOs, entrepreneurs and academic institutions) in the region, helping them develop and scale solutions to urban development problems.
The STF also explores new ways of financing these urban innovations, looking beyond traditional funding sources to find creative ways to support good ideas.
In the new phase of the Slovak Transformation Fund (2025-2028), STF is set to scale its impact through six key changes: deepening our gender and inclusion work, strengthening its catalytic role of urban innovations, expanding city engagement, aligning BOOST and CEF more closely, and elevating innovative finance work.
To that end, UNDP is seeking a Portfolio Coordinator to lead the Mission-Oriented Economy Programme within the Mayors for Economic Growth Facility (60% of the contract) and urban portfolios within the City Experiment Fund (40% of the contract).
Duties And Responsibilities
The Portfolio Coordinator will lead the work of designing, developing and coordinating the Mission-Oriented Economy Programme of M4EG and support urban portfolios under the City Experiment Fund of the STF.

Project Manager,Portfolio Coordinator - Urban Missions (Home-Based),Greater Istanbul,2 week,100,No workplace info,No employment info,"About the job
Job Description
Background
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion are core principles at UNDP: we value diversity as an expression of the multiplicity of nations and cultures where we operate, we foster inclusion as a way of ensuring all personnel are empowered to contribute to our mission, and we ensure equity and fairness in all our actions. Taking a ‚Äòleave no one behind‚Äô approach to our diversity efforts means increasing representation of underserved populations. People who identify as belonging to marginalized or excluded populations are strongly encouraged to apply. Learn more about working at UNDP including our values and
inspiring stories.
UNDP does not tolerate sexual exploitation and abuse, any kind of harassment, including sexual harassment, and discrimination. All selected candidates will, therefore, undergo rigorous reference and background checks.
The role of the Portfolio Coordinator for Urban Missions will be to support mission-based urban planning under the Mayors for Economic Growth Facility and the Slovak Transformation Fund initiatives.
Since 2021, the IRH Innovation Team has led the regional implementation of the EU-funded ‚ÄúMayors for Economic Growth‚Äù (M4EG), implemented in five Eastern Partnership (EaP) Countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine). The M4EG offers resources, networking and learning opportunities to explore new trajectories of growth and to make towns and cities more attractive for people and investment through new ways of local economic planning. The M4EG takes a 'hyperlocal' and whole-of-place approach and offers training and capability development opportunities for local authorities through the Urban Learning Center, as well as grant programmes for municipalities to test new approaches and tools. As of end of 2024, the network of mayors/municipalities totals 433, with close to 50 of those implementing grants at the local level. 10 cities have been developing their comprehensive Urban Transformation Portfolios with the mission-based approach (utilizing UNDP‚Äôs Portfolio Design & Management approach) to address their complex development challenges ranging from topics like energy transition into start-up ecosystem development and digital cultural heritage. See the M4EG website (eum4eg.com) for more information on the second phase of the initiative.
In the new phase of the M4EG (2025-2028) the main objective of the M4EG is inclusive, green and innovative economic revival of secondary cities in EaP through systemic local economic planning, enhanced access to finance, amplified future-ready capabilities and strengthened local, regional and global networks.
The Facility Will Focus On Two Main Outcomes
Improved and adaptive systemic local-level economic development planning and implementation through improved tools and capabilities for mission-oriented development and;
Enhanced access to financing for local authorities through support for pipeline development and financing absorption and management.
The new phase of the M4EG will run a Mission-Oriented Economy Programme to support up to 20 secondary cities within the M4EG network in developing a framed mission for their economies. This programme aims to build local capacities, drive economic and social development, and attract diverse investments in thematic areas such as the inclusive green transition, blue economy, urban resilience, smart and inclusive transitions and cultural economy. Participating cities will design systemic interventions that propose new ways of working within local administrations, enhance cross-sectoral collaboration, and positively impact city vibrancy while embracing technological advancements. The primary focus is on secondary cities across the EaP region, with seed investments allocated to 20 local authorities to develop interconnected portfolios tailored to local contexts. The action will support local authorities in designing and implementing mission portfolios of interventions that are connected (addressing multiple system levers), cross-sectoral (cutting across governance, economy, and environment), and dynamic (generating insights every three months to inform future investments and create new options). A design principle for all interventions is local ownership, community engagement and gender quality. The approach aims to enhance local governments' capabilities in collaborative project design and iteration, improve project invertibility, and leverage diverse funding sources.
The Slovak Transformation Fund is a project within the Innovation Team in the Regional Bureau for Europe and Central Asia. We take a systems thinking-based approach to addressing the complex development challenges of the region, collaborating closely with public, private and nonprofit sectors. The main objective of the Slovak Transformation Fund (STF) is to drive meaningful system transformation in the Eurasia region. This will be achieved by deploying systems approaches that demonstrably enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of local ecosystems, engaging stakeholders in co-creation processes to address complex challenges, fostering innovation and resilience, and leveraging innovative sources of financing to increase investment in pilots and initiatives that can drive change. The STF aims to achieve tangible effects for the green, just and smart transitions, thereby contributing to a more dynamic and sustainable future for the region.
The Project Achieves This In Two Main Ways
Through City Experiment Fund (CEF), by working directly with cities to address their complex challenges and develop portfolios of innovative solutions. STF supports them in testing and implementing these ideas, using a flexible, learning-based approach.
Through BOOST Acceleration program, STF accelerates the growth of promising innovators (e.g. CSOs, entrepreneurs and academic institutions) in the region, helping them develop and scale solutions to urban development problems.
The STF also explores new ways of financing these urban innovations, looking beyond traditional funding sources to find creative ways to support good ideas.
In the new phase of the Slovak Transformation Fund (2025-2028), STF is set to scale its impact through six key changes: deepening our gender and inclusion work, strengthening its catalytic role of urban innovations, expanding city engagement, aligning BOOST and CEF more closely, and elevating innovative finance work.
To that end, UNDP is seeking a Portfolio Coordinator to lead the Mission-Oriented Economy Programme within the Mayors for Economic Growth Facility (60% of the contract) and urban portfolios within the City Experiment Fund (40% of the contract).
Duties And Responsibilities
The Portfolio Coordinator will lead the work of designing, developing and coordinating the Mission-Oriented Economy Programme of M4EG and support urban portfolios under the City Experiment Fund of the STF. In addition, s/he is expected to work closely with the country offices and the M4EG and STF Regional Project Managers in building both regional and national partnerships for portfolio and mission programmes.
Design, develop and coordinate the Mission-Oriented Economy Programme of M4EG:
Design processes for mission programme with the aim of engaging diverse partners and enhancing cross-sectoral collaboration;
Support local authorities, partners and UNDP COs in the design of portfolios of interventions ‚Äì entailing applying systems thinking in identifying system levers, strategic entry points and set of interventions to be captured in the mission briefs for local development;

Engage with partners and donors to share lessons learned;
Support the Project Managers in the engagement with local authorities, by creating clear messages & reflections from the learnings;
